Your architecture plan for the Wedding Dashboard is **approved**. You understood the project very well and the proposed structure is exactly what I want. Please proceed to the implementation phase now, following your own phases (Database & Auth → Dashboard UI → Guest Management → Settings → Real-time & polish).

Below are my answers to your clarification questions and some additional instructions:

---

## 1. Admin Setup (Bride & Groom Access)

- We will **pre-create the admin accounts** in Supabase.
- Please assume two admin users (bride and groom) will be inserted directly into the `admin_users` table via Supabase or SQL.
- Implement **login only** (no public self-registration form for admins).
- The dashboard must be **strictly private** for these admin users.

You can assume a structure like:
- `admin_users`:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `auth_user_id` (UUID from Supabase auth.users)
  - `role` (e.g. 'bride', 'groom', 'admin')
  - `created_at`

Make sure the `admin_users` table is linked properly with `auth.users`, and restrict dashboard access based on this.

---

## 2. Guest Export Format

- Implement **CSV export** of the guest list.
- Include at least the following columns (based on the existing RSVP data model):
  - guest_id
  - name
  - email
  - phone (if available)
  - status (Confirmed / Pending / Declined)
  - party_size / number_of_guests (if available)
  - created_at

Add an “Export CSV” button in the Guests Dashboard page.

If you wish, you may structure the code so that adding PDF/Excel later will be easy, but for now **CSV is enough**.

## 3. Analytics / Charts

Yes, I **do want analytics visualizations**, but keep them **simple and not over-engineered**.

- Add a basic **Analytics section** inside the Guest Dashboard with:
  - Total guests
  - Confirmed guests
  - Pending guests
  - Declined guests
  - Sum of total expected attendees (sum of party sizes for confirmed guests, if that field exists)

Also include at least:
- One bar chart or pie chart showing RSVP status distribution.

Use a **lightweight React chart library** that fits well with the current stack and aesthetic (for example Recharts or a similar modern chart library). Keep styling consistent with the luxurious wedding design.

No need to implement complex time-series analytics for now.

## 4. Notifications for New RSVPs

To simplify the project, **do NOT implement notifications or email alerts for now**.

- Do not implement email notifications.
- Do not implement toggles or settings related to notifications.

You may still keep the architecture clean so that notifications can be added in the future if needed, but for this version, **notifications are out of scope**.

---

## 5. Guest Fields

To keep the system simple and focused, **do NOT add extra custom fields for guests beyond what is already defined in the existing RSVP system**.

- Use only the fields that are already present in the current Supabase RSVP table (such as name, email, phone, status, number_of_guests, etc.).
- Do not add new fields like `dietary_restrictions`, `message_to_couple`, `side`, or `category` unless they already exist in the current schema.

The goal is to integrate the dashboard cleanly with the existing RSVP data without expanding the data model unnecessarily.

## 6. Invitation Settings Page – Details

Your plan for a **tabbed Settings interface** is perfect. Please implement:

Tabs such as:
1. **General**
   - Bride and groom names
   - Wedding date, time, and venue
   - RSVP deadline
2. **Content**
   - Main invitation message
   - Secondary texts / manifesto
   - Dress code
3. **Media**
   - Hero image URL
   - Background theme option (e.g. ‘terracotta’, ‘emerald’, etc.) if relevant
4. **Timeline**
   - Editable story/cards for the couple’s journey
5. **Social**
   - Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, website / other social links

Requirements:
- Changes must be stored in an `event_settings` (or similar) table.
- The **public invitation page** must read from these settings dynamically.
- Implement **auto-save** where reasonable (or a clear “Save” button with feedback).
- Include a **Live Preview panel** inside the Settings page if possible, mimicking how the changes will look on the actual public invitation.

## 7. Security & RLS

Please fully implement the security model you described in your architecture:

- **RLS policies**:
  - Public read access to only the necessary invitation content and RSVP insert.
  - Admin-only read/write access to `admin_users`, full guest data, and `event_settings`.
- Secure protected routes:
  - `/dashboard/login` (public)
  - `/dashboard/guests` (protected)
  - `/dashboard/settings` (protected)
  - `/dashboard/profile` (protected)
- Use `react` + `Supabase` best practices for:
  - Session handling
  - Logout
  - Redirecting to login when unauthenticated
- Keep all **Supabase secret keys** out of the frontend. Use only the public anon key where appropriate and rely on RLS.

## 8. Implementation Style

Please now proceed with your implementation phases. For each phase:

1. **Show me the code step-by-step**, with:
   - Updated database schema (SQL for tables + RLS)
   - Important TypeScript/Type definitions (if used)
   - React components and pages
   - Any hooks or utilities for Supabase, auth, or state management
2. Ensure:
   - Clean, modular file structure as you proposed
   - Strong typing where applicable
   - Reuse of existing design system (Tailwind, Radix, Framer Motion)
   - Consistent luxury theme (Terracotta / Mediterranean minimalism)

You do **not** need to ask for further confirmation between every tiny step. Use this message as a full green light to:

- Implement the database layer,
- Implement the dashboard UI and routing,
- Implement guest management, analytics, export,
- Implement settings and live preview,
- Implement security and RLS,
- Add reasonable polish.

When you present code, please:
- Clearly separate files and paths
- Mention where each file should be located inside the existing project structure
- Include any necessary configuration updates.

You are an expert senior full-stack developer. Please start coding now based on everything above and on your original architecture document.
